Alright, so it's that time of the year again where everyone declares "goals" that last a week or two. This year, I thought I'd give a couple tips / apps that could help out with your hopefully sucsessful goals. Here's a couple of my favorite things that help me work:

## #1 Keep your tasks organized

### Wunderlist (_free_) - [link](http://wunderlist.com) 

This is so important, I literally can't even ;)

One of the best ways you can keep your tasks organized is with a **Task Manager App**. I prefer [Wunderlist](http://wunderlist.com) (Free) because it syncs well between all of my devices and other people can be added extremely easily.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
