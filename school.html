	<h2>9th Grade</h2>
	<div class="row">

				<span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Self Portrait Project <i class="mdi-navigation-close right"></i></span>
				<p>We were required to take a picture of ourselves, and make a self portrait on illustrator based off of that picture. I used what we learned about the pen tool basically the entire time on this project. The entire body was made with the pen tool, including everything but the background and the hair. For the hair I used a paint brush and made a bunch of small strokes over an object that I made with the pen tool. i also changed the colors up a bunch to make the picture a little more fun.</p>

			<div class="card-reveal">
				<span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Logo Project <i class="mdi-navigation-close right"></i></span>
				<p>Each student in the class was required to make a personal logo including either their initials, full name, or first name using Illustrator. We also had to make a PowerPoint presentation to go with it. Instead of using Powerpoint I made my presentation using Prezi. For the logo, I made the entire thing in Illustrator (so I could resize it as a I please) and made a simple circle with my initials in the middle. I then changed the opacity around and played with fonts until I got the combination that I liked.</p>

				<span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Bouncing Ball <i class="mdi-navigation-more-vert right"></i></span>

			<div class="card-reveal">
				<span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Bouncing Ball <i class="mdi-navigation-close right"></i></span>
				<p>This was a the first Flash CS6 project that we experimented with in my Animation class. We had to utilize Illustrator to design a ball and then make it bounce using Flash. I am not a fan of using flash and I would probably never use it again although this project gave me some eyesight into the future of using animation on the web.</p>
